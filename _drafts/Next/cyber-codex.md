This will be a link to my Obsidian Vault available on Github for download (Perhaps in the future host it with Obsidian Publish, to allow people to fully navigate the connections as well - Look into this)

Can have Tool notes that will describe all of the commands perhaps, with headings for different platforms or actions with descriptions down the page under headers, with a table at the top that allows you to go to those sections and quickly reach a specific command to copy it? or just use search functionality.

Can have glossary of terms for cyber security from try hack me and hack the box. Can then also build on terms im learning of what they mean or how they work, and connect them together to knowlege map them, then I can create tags for certain contexts the information is relevant, but could also link as related if similar but in different context use, and then unified pages to bring them together like tool or concept maps. Then can make use of bookmarks to save the graph views of certain topics to help navigate them to some extent.

And can try and create a roadmap of my learning to some degree as a mindmap in canvas for others to follow as well if they would want to. As well as similar to Try Hack Me and Hack the Box to show what the job role paths perhaps to some degree as well.
