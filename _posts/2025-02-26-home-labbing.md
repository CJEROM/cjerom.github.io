## What is a Home Lab?

A home lab is like its name suggests a mini laboratory in the comfort of your home composed of technological equipment, whether that be just a single device or an entire network, they are there for you to experiment running multiple services, applications, devices and configuration. You have the freedom to do what you want with it, it's yours! 

## What can a Home Lab do?

It may sound vague but anything you find interesting, whether it is self hosting all the services you pay for or keeping all your data local for privacy or to experimenting with enterprise equipment or software. The world is your oyster! Invest in yourself and learn new skills through experience and solve your or others' problems.

## Why should start a Home Lab?

Home labs can be implemented to regain control over your data, with privacy concerns all the time, you might consider running open source programs yourself to replace commercial products, which can also end up paying for itself as licensing can be a big part of your costs in IT that you would save on. However, due to this regained control your lose the convenience you might have, but that comes as a learning opportunity to learn how to set up these systems and build experience and skills related to them, which invests into your career and future to apply in enterprise environments.

## Why you shouldn't start a Home Lab

Now before you jump into doing one, there are some things to keep in mind to decide if it is something suitable for you. Now all of these can reasonably be addressed if you remain aware and mindful of some of these issues beforehand.

#### Incurring costs for equipement

Equipement can be expensive, and it can be tempting to buy the next new toy of hardware to experiment with but that comes at a cost, so its always important to only buy for what you NEED, if you find your systems can't run something, investigate in what it is and source that need if it is an important upgrade. DO NOT splash cash at every problem you face!

#### Power Consumptions & Utility Bill

Depending on your equipement and the nature of your lab meaning you will most likely be having it run 24/7, you could add up quite a bit to your utility bills per month which can add up over time, so something to keep in mind.

#### Space constraints & Noise Level

Do you have the space or a separate room that you can place your equipement in (depending on the size of your setup)? And how loud will your equipement be? How will this influence where you put it so that it doesn't become an anoyance while its running 24/7.

#### Learning Curve & Maintenance

The learning curve for managing your own home lab can be quire steep, like any skill you invest time and energy into it and improve gradually. However, depending on what you are running there can be some really great documentation out there, and remember you are not alone! You can always ask for help in a forum, just don't expect them to respond or help instantly. You will have to ExPeRiMeNt! Maintaining your home lab, with updates and security might be a time consuming process as well.

#### Distraction without clear Goals

Finally, without clear goals of things you wanna do with your home lab, you are very prone to getting distracted in your experimentation that you stay away from actual work or what is important. So clearly define your use cases, and plan different levels of implementation. You don't need to do everything at once, take it a step at a time.

## Why am I starting a home lab?

I came across this concept a while ago but only truly started to understand what it entails about a month ago, and the moment I did, I was instantly excited at the prospects of something practical I can get my hands on to learn. I learn best when I practice doing something so finding this method to learn IT in combination with reading up about it is like a dream come true, and made me feel like a kid at a candy store. I just wanted to get my hands on it straight away.

## What do I need to get started?

All you need is an old laptop or raspberry pi to try and run some services on, and you are ready to go.

Don’t get carried away with hardware! If you find your current hardware is not able to supply your needs, upgrade a little bit at a time, but most importantly think before you buy and do your research, you might be able to plan for future expansion, and most importantly SET A BUDGET!

## Some Extra Considerations

For most home labs or services you might try to run locally you'll end up running them 24/7, so take into account:
- Your utility bill due to power usage.
- How loud it might be to run, try and keep it in a hidden corner where it won't be heard if it's loud and obnoxious.
- How close is it to a router, or how easy is it to get an ehternet connection to it?
- How big is it? Do you have a space to put it?
- How expensive is your setup, are you using old computers? or investing into newer ones?

## Why haven’t I started one yet?

Well, sadly I tried but failed to get even started. I had 2 old desktop computers to play with, but after recently moving house we chucked most old wires away so I was missing one niche cable for one of them and the other was wayyyy to old, it was running 2GB of DDR2 memory and struggling to even run Windows 10 without significant lag or crashes, so too old to be reliable.

Second alternative was 2 old laptops I remembered, now one of them had the same problem where it was running 2GB of DDR2 RAM  as well, so I left that guy alone. The other laptop had power cable problems, where it would only receive power if plugged in a specific way and the battery is also either dead, broken or both.

Now you could ask me why I didn't just buy a new cable, or buy the parts or do the repairs. In response I would tell you that I am significantly low on funds, so that put my dreams to starting as soon as possible on hold. But around May I will be good so you'll here back from me soon.

What I will do when I do when I next have money is invest in a £150-220 mini PC like this [one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BOSGAME-Computers-Windows-Desktop-Gen3-2/dp/B0CQLXTH9Y/ref=asc_df_B0CQLXTH9Y?mcid=89741a06d2503c09bd2ea316a3ac2df6&tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=696386561236&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=696901726732721149&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007064&hvtargid=pla-2276639830958&gad_source=1&th=1), because:

- the processor and other components are a lot newer and modern
- they run quite silently so being on 24/7 won't be much of a disturbance
- it is small and compact so will fit in my living room without taking up much space or making it ugly
- next to my router it has as easy and convenient ethernet connection
- they tend to be very power efficient so would save on utility bills per month compared to older or larger devices.

Ultimately, it has everything I could need for my first home server for now and probably for the forseeable future while being a rather cheap option. Alternatively, you can go on things like Ebay, Amazon and get some second hand old computers for like £20-50, however they might not give you all of the benefits a mini pc would.

## Why listen to me?

Now after hearing me chat away about home servers without owning one, why listen to me?

> a wise man listens to advice :)

So on that note take what you can from what i've learned reading up about home labs, and by all means go and do your own research and find out things for yourself on how to get started, and even better, get started before me and tell me your thoughts or any thing extra I am missing out on. 

I'm open to listening to any advice.
